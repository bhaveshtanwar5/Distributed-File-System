Distributed File System (DFS) with Fault Tolerance
Contributors License

Overview
This project implements a Distributed File System (DFS) with Fault Tolerance using Python, C++, gRPC, and PostgreSQL. The system supports file chunking, replication, inter-node communication, and monitoring. It is designed to be scalable, resilient, and efficient.

Features
File Chunking: Splits large files into smaller chunks.
Replication: Ensures fault tolerance by storing each chunk on three different nodes.
gRPC Communication: Uses gRPC for inter-node messaging.
Metadata Storage: PostgreSQL is used to track file metadata, chunks, and node information.
Monitoring & Logging: Integrated with Prometheus & Grafana.
CLI-Based Interface: Users interact with the DFS through a command-line interface.
Tech Stack
Programming Languages: Python (for gRPC), C++ (for performance-critical parts)
Database: PostgreSQL
RPC Framework: gRPC
Monitoring Tools: Prometheus & Grafana
Development Environment: WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or native Linux
System Architecture
Architecture Diagram

Client sends file upload/download requests.
Metadata Server tracks file chunks and node locations.
Storage Nodes store chunks and replicate them for fault tolerance.
gRPC Communication ensures efficient and scalable inter-node communication.
PostgreSQL Database maintains metadata consistency.
Monitoring Tools provide real-time insights into system performance.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
C++ Compiler
PostgreSQL
gRPC & Protocol Buffers
Prometheus & Grafana (for monitoring)
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/suyashpundir/Distributed-File-System.git
cd Distributed-File-System
Set up the virtual environment & dependencies:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Setup PostgreSQL database:
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE dfs_db;"
psql -U postgres -d dfs_db -f db/schema.sql
Compile and run the gRPC services:
python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I./grpc_proto --python_out=./grpc_proto --grpc_python_out=./grpc_proto grpc_proto/dfs.proto
python server/dfs_server.py
Run the client:
python client/dfs_client.py
Usage
Upload a File:
python client/dfs_client.py --upload file.txt
Download a File:
python client/dfs_client.py --download file.txt
Monitor Performance:
prometheus & grafana-server
Troubleshooting
gRPC Import Errors: Ensure grpcio and grpcio-tools are installed:
pip install grpcio grpcio-tools
PostgreSQL Connection Issues: Check if PostgreSQL is running and accessible:
sudo systemctl status postgresql
Roadmap
Implement access control and authentication.
Optimize chunk placement algorithms.
Improve fault recovery mechanisms.
Add cloud storage integration (AWS S3).
